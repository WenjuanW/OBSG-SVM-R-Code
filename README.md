# OBSG-SVM-R-Code
In this repository, we uploaded two R code files. 

OBSG-SVM Experiment case One is for the first experiment in the paper. This file includes the OBSG-SVM and online SVM for online training and bach testing procedure. The algorithms first training on the training set with one online pass, then test the model with the testing set.

OBSG-SVM Experiment case Two is for the second experiment in the paper. This file includes the OBSG-SVM and online SVM for online learning with one online pass. With each coming data point. The algorithm first predict and then receive the true label and adjust the model. 

Import datasets R file is for importing the dataset into R. In this file, we put the best step-size stepc for each dataset. You have to use the best step size in the algorithms for each dataset respectively in order to get the same results as in the paper.
